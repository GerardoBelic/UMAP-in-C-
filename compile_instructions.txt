Considerations:
	1) C++ compiler with support to C++20
	2) Depending on the compiler, you may suppress the final flag "-ldl"
	3) The flag "-march=native" may generate a .exe that only works in your machine, so delete if necessary
	4) The flag "-ffast-math" may present some accuracy errors, delete if necessary
	5) The compilation was done with GCC 12.2.0 + LLVM/Clang/LLD/LLDB 14.0.6 + MinGW-w64 10.0.0 MSVCRT Runtime
	   and MSYS2 MinGW64 12.2.0 (this last one with the "-ldl" flag suppressed)
